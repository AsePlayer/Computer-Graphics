NOTE: We are partners in this class. Justin mistakenly submitted the assignment without my name earlier, but rest assured, this is not plagerism!

These are the two example codes you sent, with an edited version of the 2D one.
The code was already commented pretty well, so I didn't add any more.
Pretty sure it just needs C++ and OpenGL to run, and you definitely already have that.

They run like your tutorial on the powerpoint:

1. g++ filename.cpp -o anyname -lglut -lGLU -lGL
2. ./anyname
